Object Oriented JavaScript Interview QUESTIONS :-

1)Object :-
An Object is a unique entity and a instance of class which contains
property and methods. Properties are nothing but the characteristics of class
where as method is a property of object whose value is a function.

Characteristic of an object can be type,scope.

*Various methods of Objects :-
a) Object.create() :- It is used to create a new object using an existing object as 
	a prototype.
	
	Eg:- const temp = {
			isStydying : false,
			tempFunc : function() {
				.....
			}
		};
		
		const temp2 = object.create(temp);
		temp2.isStydying = true;
		temp2.tempFunc();

2)Class :-
Classes are blueprints of an object. It's more of a template whose instances are Objects.

*JS classes were introduced in ES6 which are the syntatical sugar over JS's prototype
based inheritance.

*We can make class by two methods :- 
a)Class declaration :- when we define a class by using "class" keyword.

class temp {
	constructor(name,place) {
		this.name = name;
		this.place = place;
	}
}

b) class expressions :- while defining a class using expressions class_name is optional.
Eg:- const demoClass = class {
	constructor(name,place) {
		this.name = name;
		this.place = place;
	}
} 	

3)Encapsulation :-
The process of Wrapping property and function within a single unit is called Encapsulation.
